## Build Instructions

### JetBrains CLion

the project was originally created using *CLion 2021.3.4*, so all what you have to do is importing the project to *CLion* and run *main.c*.

## Project Structure

* **execution**: contains all libraries responsible for executing both native and built-in commands.
* **io**: contains all libraries responsible for processing data input and output including parsing them.
* **store**: all stored data are stored there. Environment variables & Jobs are stored in linked lists, while history is stored locally in a file called *.geeekybash_history* found in user home directory.
